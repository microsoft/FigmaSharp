# FigmaSharp

> Here at Microsoft we ❤️ [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). We use it for everything and anything. So much so, we thought why not use it to actually implement our user interfaces? Sounds crazy enough to work. Let's give this a go.

FigmaSharp converts Figma documents into .NET objects and provides the tools to turn them into working native UI views. Free and Open Source software under the [MIT LICENSE]().

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/netonjm/FigmaSharp.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/netonjm/FigmaSharp)


# Getting started

To get documents from [figma.com](https://www.figma.com/) you'll need to generate a **Personal Access Token**.
Sign in to Figma and in the main menu, go to **Help and Account  →  Account Settings** and select **Create new token**.
This will be your only chance to copy the token, so make sure you keep a copy in a secure place.

We recommend trying out automatic builds of the example app and Visual Studio extension on the [Releases](/releases) page. 


# Building from source

Restore the external dependencies by running `git submodule update --init --recursive`.

To run the examples, open `FigmaSharp.sln` in [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/).
In each example project's **Project Options**, go to **Run → Configurations → Default** and add an environment variable called `TOKEN`, then paste in your Personal Access Token.


## The FigmaSharp API

There are several ways to load Figma documents into your app: from a [Url](), [File](), or [String]().
Here's how to do it with a URL:

```csharp
using System;
using FigmaSharp;

namespace FigmaSharpExample
{
    static class Main
    {
        // Put your Figma token and URL here
        const string FIGMA_TOKEN = "13c44-b0f20d98-815c-48b7-83de-1f94504b98bd";
        const string FIGMA_URL = "https://www.figma.com/file/QzEga2172k21eMF2s4Nc5keY";

        static void Main (string [] args)
        {
            FigmaEnvironment.SetAccessToken (FIGMA_TOKEN);
            var document = FigmaDocument.FromUrl (FIGMA_URL);
        }
    }
}
```

This results in a `FigmaDocument`, which is a hierarchy of `FigmaNode`s, and some metadata.

## FigmaSharp.Cocoa

This is where the real magic happens. Being able to use Figma documents in C# is nice enough, but we can go one step further and use them to draw native UI views. Currently FigmaSharp only supports Cocoa using [Xamarin.Mac](), but others (e.g. WPF, Windows, WinForms) may be added later (contribute!).


### 1. Rendering native views and controls

* [NSView.FromFigmaFile()](FigmaSharp/blob/master/FigmaSharp.Cocoa/FigmaViewExtensions.cs#L44)
* [NSView.FromFigmaUrl()](FigmaSharp/blob/master/FigmaSharp.Cocoa/FigmaViewExtensions.cs#L55)
* [NSView.FromFigmaString()](FigmaSharp/blob/master/FigmaSharp.Cocoa/FigmaViewExtensions.cs#L80)


```csharp
using System;
using AppKit;

using FigmaSharp;
using FigmaSharp.Views;
using FigmaSharp.Cocoa;

namespace CocoaExample
{
    public partial class ViewController : NSViewController
    {
        const string FIGMA_TOKEN = "13c44-b0f20d98-815c-48b7-83de-1f94504b98bd";
        const string FIGMA_URL = "https://www.figma.com/file/QzEga2172k21eMF2s4Nc5keY";
    
    
        public ViewController (IntPtr handle) : base (handle)
        {
        }

        public override void ViewDidLoad ()
        {
            base.ViewDidLoad ();
            FigmaEnvironment.SetAccessToken (FIGMA_TOKEN);
            
            List<FigmaImageView> figmaImageViews;
            View = NSView.FromFigmaUrl (FIGMA_URL, out figmaImageViews);
            figmaImageViews.Load (FIGMA_URL);
        }
    }
}
```


### 2. Template generation

It's not always possible nor desirable to connect to [figma.com]() to load your documents each time. Here's how you can generate template code from a Figma document using the `FigmaFile` [API]().


In your solution tree it should look something like this:

```
|
|---+ MyDialog.figma
|   |- MyDialog.figma.cs
|
```

Make sure the name part of each file is the same and and their **Build Action** should be set to `EmbeddedResource`.
Let's take the `MyDialog.figma` file and render the view using Cocoa. We'll need the following two files:


```csharp
// MyDialog.figma.cs
//
// This template has been automatically generated by FigmaSharp 0.1
//
// File: https://www.figma.com/file/QzEgq2772k2eeMF2sVNc3kEY
// Date: 2019-12-03 18:22

using AppKit;

public partial class MyDialog
{
    NSTextField Title;
    NSTexfield Description;

    NSButton CancelButton;
    NSButton DoneButton;
}
```

```csharp
// MyDialog.cs

using FigmaSharp;
using FigmaSharp.Cocoa;

public partial class MyDialog : FigmaFile
{
    public MyDialog () : base ("MyDialog.figma")
    {
        Initialize ();
        Load (withImages: true,
              withControls: true);
              
        DoneButton += delegate {
            // Application logic
        };
    }
}
```

Here `Initialize ()`  sets  `FigmaFile.Document` as a [FigmaDocument]().

`Load ()` takes the initialized `FigmaDocument` and images and creates a native `NSView` as `FigmaFile.ContentView`, which you can now use in your Cocoa app. When you set the `withControls:` argument to true, any component in the Figma document that was used from this [set of special Figma components](https://www.figma.com/file/QzEgq2772k2eeMF2sVNc3kEY/macOS-Components?node-id=7%3A1788) will render as working native Cocoa controls.



### 3. Bundling Figma files

The logic here is the same as before, but instead of generating a template the `.figma` file is included in the solution, and the generation of the views is done at runtime.

`.figma` files are essentially JSON files aqcuired from the Figma REST API and are accompanied by a `.figma.cs` file that defines all the UI objects.

In your solution tree it should look something like this:

```
|
|---+ MyDialog.figma
|   |- MyDialog.figma.cs
|   |- MyDialog.cs
|
```

We recommend using the Bundler tool for bundling and template generation included in the…


## Tools

The **FigmaSharp.Tools** folder contains some helpful tools for handling Figma files:

- **Inspector** – preview how your Figma document looks when rendered natively
- **Bundler** – takes a figma.com URL and downloads the .figma file including all images and adds it to your project

 [This extension](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FigmaSharp/) integrates the inspector and bundler directly into [Visual Studio for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/) for ease of use.
